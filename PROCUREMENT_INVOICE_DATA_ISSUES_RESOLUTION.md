### **Data Verification Queries**:

```sql
-- Check Purchase Orders with full details
SELECT
    po.OemPoNumber,
    d.DealName,
    c.CompanyName,
    p.ProductName,
    o.OemName,
    po.OemPoAmount,
    po.PaymentStatus,
    po.AmountPaid
FROM PurchaseOrders po
INNER JOIN Deals d ON po.LicenseId = d.DealId
INNER JOIN Companies c ON d.CompanyId = c.CompanyId
INNER JOIN Products p ON d.ProductId = p.ProductId
INNER JOIN Oems o ON d.OemId = o.OemId
WHERE d.DealName LIKE 'SAMPLE_%';

-- Check Invoice Payments with deal context
SELECT
    i.InvoiceNumber,
    i.InvoiceType,
    d.DealName,
    i.TotalAmount,
    i.PaymentStatus,
    i.PaymentReceived,
    i.BusinessPhase
FROM CbmsInvoices i
INNER JOIN Deals d ON i.DealId = d.DealId
WHERE d.DealName LIKE 'SAMPLE_%';
```

## üöÄ **Performance Optimizations**

### **Database Query Optimizations**:

- Added proper `Include()` statements for navigation properties
- Optimized LINQ queries in both controllers
- Reduced database round trips with single queries

### **View Optimizations**:

- Ensured proper ViewBag data passing
- Optimized conditional rendering in views
- Added proper null checking for navigation properties

## üîß **Configuration & Environment**

### **Database Requirements**:

- Entity Framework Core migrations up to date
- Proper foreign key relationships configured
- Execute `SQL_Scripts/Insert_Sample_Data.sql` for sample data

### **User Access Requirements**:

## üìù **Production Deployment Notes**

### **Before Production**:

1. **Clean Controllers**: ‚úÖ Test data methods removed from both controllers
2. **SQL Script**: Use for development/testing environments only
3. **Data Validation**: Enhanced form validation implemented
4. **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper includes

### **Security Considerations**:

- Sample data script should not be run in production
- Admin-only access patterns maintained
- Proper role-based access controls in place

## üÜò **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **If PurchaseOrders still show 0 results**:

1. **Execute SQL Script**: Run `Insert_Sample_Data.sql` to create test data
2. **Check Database Connection**: Verify Entity Framework connection string
3. **Verify Migrations**: Ensure all database migrations are applied
4. **Check User Permissions**: Verify user has proper role access

### **If RecordPayment changes don't appear**:

1. **Check Sample Data**: Ensure invoices exist via SQL script execution
2. **Verify Payment Logic**: Check payment amount doesn't exceed outstanding balance
3. **Database Verification**: Run verification queries from the SQL script
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Ensure no stale data in browser

### **General Data Issues**:

1. **Run Sample Data Script**: Execute `Insert_Sample_Data.sql` for baseline data
2. **Check Database Logs**: Review SQL Server logs for any constraint violations
3. **Verify Foreign Keys**: Ensure proper relationships between entities
4. **Test with Fresh Data**: Use cleanup script section to reset if needed

### **SQL Script Issues**:

1. **Check Database Schema**: Ensure all tables exist before running script
2. **Verify Permissions**: Database user must have INSERT permissions
3. **Check Constraints**: Ensure no conflicting data exists
4. **Review Output**: Check script execution messages for any errors

The data display issues have been resolved with proper controller logic, enhanced error handling, and a comprehensive SQL-based testing framework that replaces the previous controller-based test methods.
